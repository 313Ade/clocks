### analog and digital clocks using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This project is mainly for learning purposes. 
It contains a digital clock and an analog clock.
The analog clock has styling. I may (or may not) add a fill effect for the clock, instead of being able to just change the clock color only. < br/>

A preview of the analog clock. Looks crude.

A preview of alarm clock. I don't know how to take user input in place of the calender input at the moment.<br>
The alarm sound used is hosted on the web. Maybe in the future I will add a change sound feature <br/>
